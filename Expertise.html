                <dt>Matrimonial Matter Advice</dt>
                <dd>In Indian society, marriage is considered as a sacrament. It is an irrevocable relationship between husband and wife established through rituals and customs. 
                    Before 1955, there was no relief available to either party in case of a failed marriage. They had to continue with the marriage and couldn’t break the marriage. 
                    After the passage of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 things changed in favor of both parties to the marriage. 
                    Now, in case of a failed marriage, the parties do not need to suffer in the marriage and can easily break their matrimonial alliance through Judicial Separation or by a Decree of Divorce.</dd>
